# docs/concepts

This section contains the markdown files which are compiled to HTML and eventually made available as conceptual documentation for the Sails framework at https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts.

### Notes
> - This README file **is not compiled to HTML** for the website.  It is just here to explain what you're looking at.
> - Depending on what branch of `sails` you are currently viewing, the domain may vary. See the top-level documentation README file for information about working with the markdown files in this repo, and to understand the branching/versioning strategy.
