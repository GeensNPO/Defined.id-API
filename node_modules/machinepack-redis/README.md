Structured Node.js bindings for Redis with support for `await`.

> Wait!  You might not want to use machinepack-redis in your app!  This package contains relatively low-level functionality, and it is designed to provide building blocks for packages that expose higher-level abstractions.  For example, it is used behind the scenes in [sails-redis](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-redis) and [sails-hook-sockets](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-hook-sockets).  **To use Redis for implementing caching in your Sails app, please use [sails-redis](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-redis) instead of this package.**
